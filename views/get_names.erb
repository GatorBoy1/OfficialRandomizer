This is a random paring app. If you give it a list of names seperated by a "," it will randomly pair them.<br>
<br>
 Should your list have an odd number of names it will add the remaining name to the last group.<br>
<br>
Enter your list of names below. Then click submit.

<form method = "post" action = "names">
	<input type = "text" autofocus="autofocus" name = "user_names">
	<input type = "submit">
</form>
